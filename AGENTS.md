# AGENTS.md — «project name»

## What this is

A homework helper where user takes a picture or puts down the question and it answers of a homework, assignment or a task and gets a review/feedback from a review - another user, teacher or a parent and gives a score and next actions proceeding, repeating, corrections etc. Initiation can be done both by the user or the reviewer.

## Commands

- `npm test` — run all tests (Vitest)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — type check
- `npm start` — run the app

Run these — never reason about what they would probably print.
"Green" means the command exited 0 just now, nothing else.

## Workflows: research and spec

### research

Goal: understand the task before planning. Read-only.

1. Gather context: existing code when there is any, libraries and
   worked examples worth reusing, external API docs if needed
2. Identify scope: which files, what rules apply, what depends on what
3. Analyze: outline what needs doing, list what is still unknown
4. Present findings and ASK about every open question —
   never resolve a guess silently
   No code, no spec, in this pass.

### spec

Goal: a specification before implementation.
Required for: new features, API changes, anything multi-file.
Write specs/features/<name>.md — structure in specs/TEMPLATE.md.

Spec Readiness checklist — the spec is NOT ready until every box holds:

- [ ] Every AC is Given/When/Then with a precise expected value
- [ ] Files to modify are listed with what changes in each
- [ ] Risk: what could break, and how to roll back
- [ ] Testing strategy covers every AC, plus error and edge cases
- [ ] Every AC has at least one named test case

## Workflows: tdd, develop, review

### tdd

Prerequisite: a spec with a testing strategy (run spec first).
For EACH acceptance criterion, in order:
RED write the failing test for THIS AC only; the test name
states the AC; run it and confirm it fails FOR THE RIGHT
REASON (missing behaviour, not a broken import)
GREEN smallest implementation that passes this test; run ALL
tests, confirm no regressions
REFACTOR remove duplication, improve names; tests stay green
Then repeat the cycle for edge cases: invalid input, boundaries,
error paths.

Two traps, both near-certain:

- The model writes test and implementation in one pass. The test is
  then derived from the code and always passes. Ask separately.
- The model "fixes" a failing test to match the code. The spec
  decides which one is wrong — correct the spec first, then the test.

### develop

For work that has a spec: read it, follow the patterns already in
the codebase, change only the files the spec lists, run tdd for the
ACs, and update the spec status Draft -> In Progress -> Done.

### review

Compare the diff against the spec: which AC each change serves, what
changed that no AC asked for, which tests prove what. End with a
verdict: APPROVED or CHANGES_REQUIRED — never prose that cannot be
branched on.

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript strict, no `any`
- ES modules
- Business logic in pure functions, testable without the CLI/UI
- interfaces for every data structure

## Guardrails

- Never touch `.env`; never run a command that deletes data
- Never "fix" a failing test by editing the test — the spec decides
  which one is wrong, and the spec is corrected first
- Stop after two consecutive red rounds and report — do not thrash

## When you notice something

One line in INBOX.md. Do not implement it, do not detour.
